sync2git
========

This will take a bunch of modules and/or packages from a koji tag, or a
koji compose, and compare against the sources in a CentOS style git
repository ... for newer versions of the modules/packages it will call
[alt-src](https://github.com/release-engineering/alt-src) to sync them.

It can filter modules/packages manually and also optionally call a
CVE checker service to filter embargoed data.

Also has optional, time limited, caching.

Default setup is to sync from internal Red Hat EL8 nightly composes to
[CentOS Stream 8](https://git.centos.org/rpms/centos-release-stream/).

Usage:
    `cron-sync2git.sh`
    `cron-sync2build.sh`
    `cron-dashboard.sh`

Other commands:
 * ./sync2git.py - Take packages from koji tag/compose and sync them to git.
 * * ./sync2git.py force-push-module N:S:V:C - Push without checking CVE.
 * * ./sync2git.py push - Push packages/modules to git (depending on options).
 * ./sync2build.py - Take packages from git and sync them to koji builds.
 * * ./sync2build.py packages
 * * ./sync2build.py modules

 * * ./access.py names name... = Query the given NVRs for local pkgs. named
 * * ./access.py file-nvrs nvr... = Query all the nvrs in the files
 * ./rpmvercmp.py = rpm version comparison in python
 * * ./rpmvercmp.py &lt;s1> &lt;s2> = compare s1 vs. s2 using rpmvercmp logic
